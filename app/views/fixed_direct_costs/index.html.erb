<h2>Fixed direct costs</h2>

<p>
  Your fixed direct costs are those where the cost is directly associated with
  the production of this product, but whose amount is fixed over the
  production levels we are examining. For example, if you have to purchase a
  piece of specialist machinery to produce this product, that would probably
  count as a fixed cost.
